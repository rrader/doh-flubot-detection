  abstract = {Recently, the Internet has adopted the DNS over HTTPS (DoH) resolution mechanism for privacy-aware network applications. As DoH becomes more disseminated, it has also become a network monitoring research topic. For comprehensive evaluation and comparison of developed classifiers, real-world datasets are needed, motivating this contribution. We created a new large-scale collection of datasets consisting of two classes of traffic: i)~DoH HTTPS communication and ii)~non-DoH HTTPS connections. The DoH traffic is captured for multiple DoH providers and clients to include nuances of various DoH implementations and configurations. The non-DoH HTTPS connections complement the DoH communication aiming to include a wide range of existing network applications. The dataset collection consists of network traffic generated in a controlled environment and traffic captured from a real ISP network. The resulting datasets thus provide real-world network traffic data suitable for evaluating existing classifiers and the development of new methods.},

  abstract = {Botnet detection systems struggle with performance and privacy issues when analyzing data from large-scale networks. Deep packet inspection, reverse engineering, clustering and other time consuming approaches are unfeasible for large-scale networks. Therefore, many researchers focus on fast and simple botnet detection methods that use as little information as possible to avoid privacy violations. We present a novel technique for detecting malware using Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA), that is able to evaluate data from large scale networks without reverse engineering a binary or performing Non-Existent Domain (NXDomain) inspection. We propose to use a statistical approach and model the ratio of DNS requests and visited IPs for every host in the local network and label the deviations from this model as DGA-performing malware. We expect the malware to try to resolve more domains during a small time interval without a corresponding amount of newly visited IPs. For this we need only the NetFlow/IPFIX statistics collected from the network of interest. These can be generated by almost any modern router. We show that by using this approach we are able to identify DGA-based malware with zero to very few false positives. Because of the simplicity of our approach we can inspect data from very large networks with minimal computational costs.},
