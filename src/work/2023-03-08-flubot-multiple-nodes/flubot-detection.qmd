# Experiment 1: Malware detection

In this part we run the FluBot detection for Top 3 normed and Top 3 unnormed models, trying 4 model sensitivities in each run.

In this experiment we have 3 Android x86 machines:

 - 192.168.2.217 - machine without benign traffic, infected with FluBot
 - 192.168.2.149 - clean machine with DoH in Chrome enabled
 - 192.168.2.249 - control machine with plaintext DNS configured
